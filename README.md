# GitHub Collaboration Guide

## Create & Share the Repository

### GitHub Manager
- One person (the **GitHub Manager**) creates the repository on GitHub
- They go to: Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Collaborators
- Add team members by their GitHub username or email.
- Everyone else will get an **email or notification**, click **"Accept Invitation"**.

### Clone the Shared Repo
Once added, each teammate runs this in their terminal:

```bash
git clone <shared-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

## Install Dependencies & Set Up `.env`
### Install Node packages
Inside the project folder:
```bash
npm install
``` 

### Create a `.env` file
```bash
touch .env
``` 
Inside .env, add your environment variables:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/your-db-name
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=3000
``` 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit .env to GitHub! Make sure it‚Äôs listed in your .gitignore.




## Branching & Code Workflow
### Branching Rules

- **Never code directly on the `main` branch.**
- Each team member should create their own feature branch before writing code.
- Follow a clear naming convention:

```bash
git checkout -b yourname-feature
```


## Daily Coding Workflow
1. Pull the latest changes from main
Before you start any work, update your local main branch:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

2. Create or Switch to Your Feature Branch
#### If you're starting a new feature:
```bash
git checkout -b yourname-feature
```

#### If you're continuing work on an existing branch:
```bash
git checkout yourname-feature
```
Then merge the latest code into the feature branch so that you can use it:
```bash
git merge main
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è When merging the newest code in the main branch into your feature branch, it's possible to create merge conflicts. 

3. Do Your Work and Commit It
After editing files, save and commit your work:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [brief description of change]"
```

> üí° Use clear, consistent commit messages like:
> add register form UI
> fix navbar layout bug
> update form validation logic

4. Sync with Latest main (to Avoid Conflicts)
Before pushing, make sure your branch has the latest updates from main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout yourname-feature
git merge main
```

  <summary>‚ÄºÔ∏è How to Resolve Merge Conflicts </summary>

1. **Switch to `main` and pull the latest code**  
```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
```
2. Switch back to your feature branch
```bash
git checkout your-feature-branch
```
3. Merge main into your branch
```bash
git merge main
```
4. Open the conflicted files
Look for conflict markers like:
```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
// your changes
=======
// incoming changes
>>>>>>> main
```
5. Manually edit the file to keep or combine code then delete the conflict markers.

6. Stage and commit the resolved file
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: resolved merge conflict"
```
7. Push your branch to GitHub
```bash
git push origin your-feature-branch
```
8. You can now finish your pull request as normal!

5. Push Your Branch to GitHub
Once your code is ready:
```bash
git push origin yourname-feature
```

6. Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to your GitHub repo.
Click "Compare & Pull Request".

Add:
- A clear title (e.g., Add login functionality)
- A short description of what you did
- Request a review from your teammates.

7. After Merging Your PR
Everyone on the team should update their local main:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

> ‚úÖ Repeat this workflow for every new feature or fix!
